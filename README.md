### Technical
______________________
- 🖼️ I'm framework agnostic. My preference is Laravel, I like FastAPI, and I can React. (if you ask nicely you'll find some Node & knockout knowledge under the hood also).
- 🗄️ I work across various databases. I handle database administration: writing optimized queries, managing backups, designing schemas, handling migrations, and tuning performance across SQL and NoSQL databases for scalable, efficient systems.
- 💻 I dabble in dev-ops. I write docker & compose (build, deploy, run), CI/CD with changesets/cli, nginx configs, Kubernetes backend services and Vercel CDN front ends.
